#### Description/Features: 
This is a form I built with jQuery that provides real time error messages, as well as on-submit error messages, when the information provided in the fields doesn't match the requirements for the form. 

## Built With:
**HTML**

**CSS**

**JavaScript**

**jQuery**

## Future Improvements:
I'd like to continue to improve the UI of this app by adding a submit confirmation page to let the user know their information was received successfully.
